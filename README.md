##Overview of the Solution
To see if displaying weather information increases visits to National Trust properties, we added a small code snippet to the property pages and set up an A/B test.

### How It Works
1. Identify Property: The code recognizes the property page a visitor is viewing.
2. Fetch Weather Data: Weather data for the property's location is retrieved from a weather service.
3. Display Weather: Only visitors in the test group see the weather information; those in the control group do not.
4. A/B Testing: Visitors are randomly assigned to either:
    *Test Group: See the weather information.
    *Control Group: Do not see the weather information.
5. Tracking: Visitor assignments are stored in local storage to ensure consistency during their visit.
### Purpose
By comparing the behavior of both groups, we can determine if showing weather information encourages more visits to the properties. This helps us make informed decisions to enhance the visitor experience on the National Trust website.
